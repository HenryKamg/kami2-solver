# Kami 2 Solver in F#

[Kami 2](http://www.stateofplaygames.com/kami2/) is a beautiful puzzle game
based on coloring oragami paper. The best way is to see how the gamelay
_unfolds_ is to just watch a [quick demo](https://youtu.be/I0S9rnqa5tQ?t=2m23s).

This repo contains a solver for Kami 2 puzzels written in F#. It takes a
screenshot of the puzzle as input, and outputs a sequence of images to
perform to solve the puzzle.

Details on the algorithm and approach can be found on my blog at:
[completely-unique.com](http://completely-unique.com).

:construction: **Not Yet Finished** :construction:

Only Part 1, loading puzzels from screen shots, is in the repo right now.
Actually solving puzzles is comming soon.
